# Happy Chocolate Day! 🍫✨

An immersive, romantic web experience designed to celebrate Chocolate Day. This project combines gamification, 3D CSS transforms, and a custom JavaScript drag-and-drop engine to create a digital gift that is both playful and sentimental.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Realistic 3D Wrapper:** A KitKat-themed wrapper featuring crimped edges, foil reflections, and a "puffed" look.
* **Custom Drag Engine:** Built using a professional delta-offset method for smooth, lag-free movement on both desktop and mobile.
* **Gamified UX:** * **Unwrap:** Slide the wrapper to tear it open.
    * **Clean Up:** The wrapper crumples into a ball; you must drag it into the **Interactive Dustbin** to unlock the chocolate.
    * **Eat:** Click chocolate pieces in a logical sequence to "eat" them.
* **Floating Love Notes:** 50+ randomized, beautiful compliments that float up with every bite.
* **Romantic Finale:** A justified, elegant Shayari popup with a "Glassmorphism" blur effect.
* **Dynamic Visuals:** Animated gradient backgrounds with floating hearts and chocolate emojis.
* **Persistence:** Uses `LocalStorage` to track daily chocolate limits, resetting automatically at midnight.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and layout.
* **CSS3:** 3D transforms (`perspective`, `rotateY`), custom animations, and responsive Grid/Flexbox.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Logic for collision detection, custom drag-and-drop, and state management.
